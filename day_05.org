* Part 1
this example consists of 2 parts, the initial configuration and the actual orders. Let's start with the configuration. i think i'd like it to end up as a list of strings like so:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'("ZN"
  "MCD"
  "P")
#+end_src

#+NAME: configuration 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var input=input

(setq commands (split-string (string-trim (car (cdr input))) "\n"))

                       (<= char ?Z))
                  (setq current-stack (concat current-stack (char-to-string char))))))
          (if (> (length current-stack) 0)
